# CSS3 Mixins for Sass

_This is taken from Jeffrey Way's CSS3 mixins for Less, and converted to Sass._

## Usages
To get access to the css3mixins, at the top of your main sass file, add `@import "css3mixins"`.  After that, you can use any of the mixins by calling `+mixin_name` or the more verbose `@include mixin_name`.
